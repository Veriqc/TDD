# A-Tensor-Network-Based-Decision-Diagram
## Overview
Decision diagrams have been used in simulation and equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, they have their own restricts. A tensor network-based decision diagram has been proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02618. This page gives a proof-of-concept implementation of the Tensor Decision Diagram(TDD) and the package is build using Python3. In order to run this package, you need to install the qiskit package and if you want to get the graphical output, please also install the graphviz package.
More benchmarks can be obtained from https://github.com/iic-jku/qmap/tree/master/examples.
